DETECTIVE
Let's put the pieces of this puzzle together. / It's clear that the crime wasn't committed by an outsider; it had to be an inside job. / Now, let's talk about the "how." How could someone sneak into the bank, break into the vault, and get away with a big pile of cash?

BANKER
(looking nervous)
I told you, Detective, I have no idea how this could have happened!

COMMISSIONER
Maybe it was an inside job, but how could BANKER have done it? He's always been loyal to this bank!

ASSISTANT
The "how" is where it gets interesting. Remember the security camera repair delay due to waiting for cash flow? That was conveniently timed, wasn't it?

DETECTIVE
Indeed. And why would someone disable the security cameras unless they had something to hide? / Someone wanted to make sure there were no witnesses to the crime.

BANKER
(defensive)
I had nothing to do with that! It was just a coincidence!

DETECTIVE
Coincidence? Let's talk about motives now. What would drive someone to commit such a crime? / BANKER, you mentioned being in the banking business for over 25 years, but were there any recent financial troubles?

BANKER
(looking uncomfortable)
Well, the bank has been doing well, but we did have some recent investments that didn't pan out as expected.

ASSISTANT
Aha! So, financial troubles could have been a motive. / Disabling the paychecks for the bank tellers, switching to cheaper cat litter - these are signs that someone was desperate to save money.

DETECTIVE
And who has the authority to make such decisions? To disable the paychecks and switch to cheaper supplies?

BANKER
(looking defeated)
I do. But I didn't think it would come to this. I was just trying to keep the bank afloat.

DETECTIVE
(despite the evidence, empathetic)
Times can be tough, BANKER, but turning to crime was not the solution. / Your actions have consequences, and you'll have to face them now.
