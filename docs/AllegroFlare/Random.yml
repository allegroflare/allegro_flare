class_methods:


  - name: get_random_int
    description: |
      Returns a random integer.

      Note this method uses in internal implementation that will guarantee the same sequence of integer numbers across
      platforms given the same seed.


  - name: get_random_float
    description: |
      Returns a random floating point number.

      Note that this method is guaranteed to return the same sequence of floating point numbers across platforms given
      the same seed.  However, due do differences of floating point implementaitons, the method is _not_ guaranteed
      to return the _exact same numerical values on all significant digits_ of the floating point value across platforms.



  - name: get_random_double
    description: |
      Returns a random double number.

      Note that this method is guaranteed to return the same sequence of numbers across platforms given
      the same seed.  However, due do differences of floating point implementaitons, the method is _not_ guaranteed
      to return the _exact same numerical values on all significant digits_ of the double value across platforms.
