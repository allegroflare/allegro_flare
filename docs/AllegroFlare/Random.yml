    ### Note about Random
    `Random` relys on the C++ implementation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister algorithm, 
    making it reliable to use for random numbers, but also for proceedural content for games.

    - `Random` will produce values that are predictably reproducable if you provide the same seed.  This will be consistent across
      platforms, compilers, devices, and executions. Unlike other implementations of random generators (C's `rand()`), `
    - Practically, `Random` will never reach a point where its content will repeat. The Mersenne Twister algorithm has a period
      of 2^19937-1, which, to be honest, is a huge number.

    Apart from the main design intention in `Random` to be useful in the context of making video games, it should be noted that
    it should not be used as a reliable source for cyptographically generated content.  You might consider other sources for that.


class_methods:


  - name: get_random_int
    description: |
      Returns a random integer.

      Note this method uses in internal implementation that will guarantee the same sequence of integer numbers across
      platforms given the same seed.


  - name: get_random_float
    description: |
      Returns a random floating point number.

      Note that this method is guaranteed to return the same sequence of floating point numbers across platforms given
      the same seed.  However, due do differences of floating point implementaitons, the method is _not_ guaranteed
      to return the _exact same numerical values on all significant digits_ of the floating point value across platforms.



  - name: get_random_double
    description: |
      Returns a random double number.

      Note that this method is guaranteed to return the same sequence of numbers across platforms given
      the same seed.  However, due do differences of floating point implementaitons, the method is _not_ guaranteed
      to return the _exact same numerical values on all significant digits_ of the double value across platforms.
